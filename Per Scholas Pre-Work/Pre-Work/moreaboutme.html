  <h2 class="MAMh3tag">A Bit More About Me</h2>
  <div class="div5">

    <p class="MAMptag1">Some of my favorite things to talk about are music.
      Music is one of my passions, but unlike other people who's passion
      is making music, mine lies in the history of music. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="div6">

    <p class="MAMptag1">Also growing up in NYC I've grown to love cycling. If you ask me cycling is the
      most efficent way to make your way around. The downside to that however is
      I have no clue how to drive a car.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="div7">
    <p class="MAMptag1">Along with music and cycling I have a deep love for hiking.This passion
      came about in high school when my gym class hiked up Breakneck Ridge. There is
      something so calming and fufilling about reaching the summit that I became addicted a
      goal of mine is to become an Adirondack 46'er which can only be done if one
      summits all 46 high peaks of the Adirondack mountains.</p>
  </div>


  <p class="MAMptag2">I'll leave you all with this Malcolm X video with the hopes that it inspires you to learn more.</p>
